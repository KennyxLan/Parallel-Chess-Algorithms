=======================================================
parallel-v1 notes:

1. Using Pthreads to parallelize the chess AI algorithms.
2. `aiplayer.cpp` -- parallelization is added.
3. `playchess.cpp` -- `search_depth` of black aiplayer has been changed from 3 to 4.
4. `fasttime.h` has been included for measurement of running times.
5. Some annotations have been added for readability.
6. Original serial code is kept.
