SIMPLE CHESS

A basic Chess AI using min-max search with alpha-beta pruning and a simplistic
approach to quiescent search.


-- COMPILE -- 

In `engine` folder, run `make`.


-- PLAY --

In `engine` folder, run `./chess`.
Enter your moves concatenating field names, e.g. 'b2b4'.

-- PROFILE --

perf record -s ./chess  # or   perf record ./chess
perf report -T          # or   perf report

=======================================================
parallel-v2 notes:

1. Make two AIPlayers play against each other.
2. Count the number of nodes evaluated by serial code and each parallel thread(including the main thread).
3. Use `fopen()` , `fprintf()` , `fclose()` and `sprintf()` to print the output in a csv file.
4. Omit `-O2` when compiling with `g++` (Makefile).
5. Other changes.
